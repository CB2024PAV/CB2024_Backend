            "Good morning, Bob! It's a beautiful Tuesday, October 24th. Remember your school days? You were quite the bright student!  You've always been a hard worker, from your time as a mechanic to becoming a plumber.  And you had a wonderful life with Alice, your wife, by your side. You even met her near a bakery in Santa Monica - just like in those old movies!  Today, why don't you try solving some puzzles like the Rubik's cube you love? It's a great way to exercise your mind.  How are you feeling today? Remember to take things slowly and avoid any loud noises or crowded places.  Have a wonderful day, Bob! \n",
